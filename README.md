# Subtract-a-Square
A simple CLI board-type game written in Python.

 2 Players have a pile of 50 coins between them.
 They have to subtract a square number of coins (1, 4, 9, etc) such that the remaining coins are not negative. 
 When the number of coins reaches 0, the game ends and the last player to subtract wins the game.
